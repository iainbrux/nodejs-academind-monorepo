# Express.js first assignment.

1. Create a npm project and install Express.js with Nodemon
1. Create an Express.js app which funnels the requests through 2 middleware functions that log something to the console and return one response.
1. Finally remove the two middleware functions and handle requests to "/" and "/users" such that each request only has one handler/middleware that does something with it (e.g. send dummy response)
