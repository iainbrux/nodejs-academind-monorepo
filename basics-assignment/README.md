# Basics Assignment

### This is to demonstrate ability and practice the materials learned in the lessons from the "Basics" section in the course.

1. Spin up a Node.js-driven Server on port 3000
1. Handle two routes: "/" and "/users"
  - Return some greeting text on "/"
  - Return a list of dummy users (e.g. User 1, User 2 etc...)
1. Add a form with a "username" <input> to the "/" page and submit a POST request to "/create-user" upon a button click.
1. Add the "/create-user" route and parse the incoming data (i.e. the username) and simply log it to the console.
